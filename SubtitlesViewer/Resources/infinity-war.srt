He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

213
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,947
That already makes him

the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

215

If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,245
He could destroy life

Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?

I'm going to allow that.

If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

223

Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

Yeah, so conversely,

his best chance against us.

To bring balance to the universe

519
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,611
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

Therefore Thanos can't get it.

00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,288
Therefore he's going

your magical ass? Me.

1096
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,657
I seriously don't know

1097
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,908
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1098
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,327
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1099
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,995
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1100
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,081
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

1101
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,832
And due to that fact,

1102
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,250
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1103
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,086
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

1104
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,171
I'm backup.
No, you're a stowaway.

1105
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,339
The adults are talking.

1106
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,092
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1107
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,885
What is he, your ward?

1108
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,053
No.

1109
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,430
I'm Peter, by the way.
Doctor Strange.

1110
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,307
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1111
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm Spider-Man, then.

1112
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,937
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1113
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,021
Thing's on autopilot.

1114
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,898
<font color="#FF0000">DR. STRANGE:</font> Can we control it?

1115
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,984
Fly us home?

1116
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,988
Stark?
Yeah.

1117
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,406
Can you get us home?

1118
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,824
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,577
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1120
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,746
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,374
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1122
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,709
I don't think
you quite understand

1123
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,793
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,295
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1125
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:04,215
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,967
Since he sent an army
to New York

1127
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,593
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,679
And I don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,014
So I'm not so sure

1130
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,890
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,686
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1132
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,063
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,983
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1134
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,151
Doctor.

1135
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,529
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,576
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1137
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,704
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,539
if it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,083
or the kid or the Time Stone...

1140
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,086
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,591
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1142
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,053
Nice. Good, moral compass.

sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,497
I hated this room.

This ship.

1152
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,626
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,299
<font color="#FF0000">THANOS:</font> You told me that too.

1154
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,846
Every day.

1155
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,600
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,564
I was a child when you took me.

1157
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,774
I saved you.

1158
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,279
No.

1159
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,325
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1160
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,660
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,871
scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,915
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1163
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,084
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,378
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1165
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,172
The children born...

1166
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,176
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1167
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,594
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,140
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1169
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,185
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1170
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,352
You're insane.

1171
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,479
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1172
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:08,441
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1173
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,987
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1174
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,488
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,032
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,619
I'm the only one who knows that.

1177
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,624
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1178
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,210
For a time...

1179
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:34,050
you had that same will...

1180
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,054
as you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,972
Daughter.

1182
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,558
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,730
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1184
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:49,941
And, in doing so,

1185
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,276
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1186
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,032
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

But not because
you didn't find it.

1191

Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1387
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,357
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1388
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,526
No, he can't take it!
She's right. You can't.

1389
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,736
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1390
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:25,946
I'll kill all three of you

1391
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:27,864
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.

1392
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,032
Starting with you.

1393
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,200
Wait, what, Thanos?

1394
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:32,369
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1395
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,538
What master do you serve?

1396
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:35,956
What master do I serve?

1397
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:37,499
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1398
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,459
You're from Earth.

1399
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,585
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1402
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,132
<font color="#FF0000">SPIDER-MAN:</font> So you're not
with Thanos?

1403
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,426

1404
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,595
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1405
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:52,597
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1406
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,142
We're the Avengers, man.
Oh.

1407
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,519
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1408
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,854
You know Thor?

1409
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,105
Yeah.

1410
01:21:00,188 --> 01:21:02,649
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1411
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,484
Where is he now?

1412
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,418
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1413
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,794
It's a mold.

1414
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,546
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:25,505 --> 01:21:27,841
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1416
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,344
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1417
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:32,971
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,390
Stormbreaker.

1419
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,975
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,103
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:44,149
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1422
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:47,319
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1423
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,574

We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1429

Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1430
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,095
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1431
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,387
pin him down, get what we need.

1432
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:16,223
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1433
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,349

01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,775
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

Okay, Mr. Clean

Uh, what exactly
