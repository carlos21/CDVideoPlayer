1
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,139
Okay.

2
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,641
Have the next outfit ready.

3
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,683
Okay.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,983
This is so annoying.

5
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,820
-When is this going to end?
-<i>I have an announcement.</i>

6
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,740
-Hey, look.
-<i>I am the detective in charge of the case.</i>

7
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:30,575
<i>About ten minutes ago,</i>

8
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,744
-<i>the respondent told</i>
-Did he show up?

9
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>that he cannot attend the questioning.</i>

10
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:37,666
What? What kind of trick
is he trying to pull?

11
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,543
He probably got scared and didn't show up.

12
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:42,504
<i>We'll tell you more
about the investigation later on.</i>

13
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:50,679
Hold on.

14
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:56,935
Get off me.

15
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:03,442
Have you looked into it?

16
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:06,611
It looks like Jin-woo met
with Cha Byeong-jun this morning.

17
00:01:06,695 --> 00:01:09,739
There are a lot of witnesses who saw him
at Cha Byeong-jun's lecture hall.

18
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:11,616
But why? Why did they meet?

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,993
How would I know?

20
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,538
Things seem to be unfolding
in an unexpected way.

21
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,081
Something doesn't feel right.

22
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,763
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

23
00:01:34,514 --> 00:01:35,515
CHA BYEONG-JUN

24
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,566
CHA BYEONG-JUN

25
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,362
<i>The number you have dialed is unavailable.</i>

26
00:01:49,446 --> 00:01:50,614
Is he not picking up?

27
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,949
What's going on?
Why is he ignoring my calls?

28
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:55,076
Did Jin-woo fool us again or what?

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,634
CHA BYEONG-JUN

30
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,478
CHA BYEONG-JUN

31
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:28,693
CHA BYEONG-JUN

32
00:02:28,777 --> 00:02:30,278
What are these bastards up to?

33
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:34,324
Hey.

34
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:36,576
Hey.

35
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,126
Did you talk to the lawyer?

36
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,462
How ridiculous...

37
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,756
He told you not to attend
the witness interview tomorrow.

38
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:52,634
Why?

39
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,469
Apparently, something's come up.

40
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,389
He didn't give me a reason.
He said you should just wait.

41
00:02:57,472 --> 00:03:00,267
Cha Byeong-jun told him to tell us that.

42
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,103
We've been fooled, completely.

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,522
I told you something didn't seem right.

44
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,816
You hung up
when he didn't tell you anything?

45
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,943
You moron, what the hell do you even do?

46
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:13,613
Bitch, why are you taking it out on me?

47
00:03:15,073 --> 00:03:15,991
Listen, you bitch.

48
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,952
You're the one who met up with
Cha Byeong-jun.

49
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:21,746
You met with him of your own accord
and cut a deal with him.

50
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,957
I warned you not to trust that old geezer.

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,709
I wondered why he wanted

52
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,669
to join hands with us out of the blue.

53
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,922
I bet he had already cut a deal
with Yoo Jin-woo.

54
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:34,009
He just used us to threaten him
and ditched us. Do you understand?

55
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:36,636
I told you not to use
that stupid head of yours.

56
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,639
You brought all this upon yourself, okay?

57
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,516
How dare you take it out on me?

58
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:46,146
God damn it, this is so frustrating.

59
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,025
I'll kill them.

60
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,027
Kill who?

61
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,987
I'll kill them all.

62
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,366
All right.

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,784
Kill them or not,

64
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,703
do whatever you want.

65
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,209
Where are you going?

66
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:10,670
I asked you where you're going!

67
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,563
Shall I really kill them all?

68
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:46,665
Hello.

69
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,835
Aren't you Go Yu-ra by any chance?

70
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,587
To Central Police Station, please.

71
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:07,686
Oh, that's Go Yu-ra!

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,521
Get her on the camera!

73
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,438
It's Go Yu-ra.

74
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:12,273
Yu-ra, please say a few words.

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,443
-You're not scheduled to be here today.
-Did it get rescheduled again?

76
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:18,363
-Why did Mr. Yoo cancel the questioning?
-Why are you here?

77
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:19,572
Please say a few words.

78
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,449
What brings you here?

79
00:05:21,658 --> 00:05:22,492
Yu-ra.

80
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:24,577
-Look over here!
-Say a few words!
